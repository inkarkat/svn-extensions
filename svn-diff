Highlights diff output red/green. 
With -b (ignore space change) and -w (ignore all white space) options. 
Can also show statistics with --stat, --numstat and --shortstat. 

Default is working copy to last commit; use
-r PREV to diff working copy with previous commit and
-r PREV:COMMITTED (or svn dp) to show change in previous commit, and
-r REV:COMMITTED to show changes across revisions. 

Usage: "$(basename "#1")" [-b] [-w] [-c M | -r N[:M]] [--stat|--numstat|--shortstat] [TARGET[@REV]...] [-?|-h|--help]
