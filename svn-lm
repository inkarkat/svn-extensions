One-line log messages of my commits with date and commit summary.
Like "svn lg" filtered for my personal commits.
--no-merge	Exclude any commits that mention merge in the revision summary.
--server	Instead of local history, only list server revisions that you
		don't have yet.
Note: svn log option -v is not supported here, but also doesn't make sense here.
