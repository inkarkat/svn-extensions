One-line log messages with date and commit summary of my commits.
Like "svn lg" filtered for my personal commits.
--no-merge	Exclude any commits that mention merge in the revision summary.
--server	Instead of local history, only list server revisions that you
		don't have yet.
Note: svn log option -v is not supported here, but also doesn't make sense here.
Usage: "$(basename "$1")" [--no-merge] [-c M | -r N[:M]] [-l|--limit ARG] [--server|PATH...] [-?|-h|--help]
